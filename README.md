# PostMalone WebApp

The web application presents my alternative design for the Artist's original website. I created it mainly to use the redux library.
I know that the application doesn't  use the full potential of the redux library. However, it is supposed to present my current skills related to this library. (so far I have used a react reducer in my projects).
  ## Main Features
    > Dynamic change of albums
    
      * Changing the background of the page
      * Changing album photo
      * Changing the tracklist
      
    > Animation of a disc sliding out from under an album photo
    
    > Changing the picture of the items to buy after hovering the mouse over
    
    > Adding / removing items to the cart
    
    > Full responsiveness of the website
