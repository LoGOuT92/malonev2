# PostMalone WebApp

The web application presents my alternative design for the Artist's original website. I created it mainly to use the redux library.
I know that the application doesn't  use the full potential of the redux library. However, it is supposed to present my current skills related to this library. (so far I have used a react reducer in my projects).

## Demo : https://malonefanpage-de1e7.web.app/

    > Dynamic change of albums
